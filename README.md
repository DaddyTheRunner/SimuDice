# SimuDice README
This repo contains the files used for my Coursera Developing Data Products class project

The project involves creating a shiny app and slide presentation.

The SimuDice shiny app simulates rolling multi-sided dice.

This [slide presentation](http://daddytherunner.github.io/SimuDice/pitch/index.html#1) gives an overview of the project.  The [source files](https://github.com/DaddyTheRunner/SimuDice/tree/gh-pages/pitch) for the presentation are available on GitHub in the `pitch` folder.

The application has a detailed [help file](http://daddytherunner.github.io/SimuDice/help.html).

Here is the project's [main repository](https://github.com/DaddyTheRunner/SimuDice).  The main repository contains all of the files needed to run the shiny app.
